# Unfied Calendar converter

This is a small SPA developed with React, Vite, Tailwind and Deno2 to convert dates between the Gregorian calendar
and the fictional Unified Calendar fetured in the novel: <a href="https://mybook.to/apartoftheworld">A Part Of The World</a>.

Discover more about the novel and the world of the Unified State at <a href="https://RMBeristain.com/apartoftheworld">RMBeristain.com</a>

There is also a <a href="https://github.com/RMBeristain/unidate">Python version</a> of this tool, in case you want to run it locally.
